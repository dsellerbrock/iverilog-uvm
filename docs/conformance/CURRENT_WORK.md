# CURRENT WORK — continuation state

This is the short resume state. `ROADMAP.md` is the living tracker,
`iverilog_ieee1800_uvm_manifesto.md` carries policy, and dated technical
narratives live in `session_logs/`.

## Resume state — 2026-07-28

Branch: `claude/ieee1800-closure-campaign-lqalye`, started fresh from
main and rebased onto `7136907`, which carries the merged PRs #125, #126
and #127. The previous PR on this branch (#121) is merged, so this is a
new pull request rather than a continuation of that one.

### Campaign 2 — whole aggregate value semantics

One missing primitive turned out to explain four separate symptoms. A
fixed unpacked array used where a container is wanted has marshaled its
words since M10-1 (`%load/arr/dar`); the **return trip did not exist**,
and each place it was needed failed differently:

| shape | what it did |
|---|---|
| `fa = da;` and `s.arr = da;` | assigned the **constant 0**, silently |
| `t(fa)` for `inout int q[]` | **aborted ivl** on legal input, even when the body only read the formal |
| `f(fa)` for `ref int q[]` | warned once, then silently left the caller's array alone |

The assignment case is the one worth remembering. `fa = da` is not
`type_compatible`, so it reached the compile-progress fallback in
`elab_and_eval` that substitutes a constant for an incompatible r-value
when the target looks vectorable — and an unpacked array's `cast_type`
is its ELEMENT type, so `int fa[3]` looked exactly that vectorable.

New `%store/arr/dar` is the inverse of `%load/arr/dar`, and all four
paths go through it. The 7.6 element-count rule is checked inside the
instruction, because a dynamic source has no size until it runs; a
mismatch reports and leaves the destination unchanged rather than
half-filling it.

The inbound direction is fixed for **real** elements too: the special
case meant to accept a fixed-array actual for an open-array formal asked
the EXPRESSION for its `netuarray_t`, but a signal expression's
`net_type()` is its element type, so the test never succeeded — integral
arrays slipped past on the vectorable fallback while real arrays took a
cast error.

Roadmap: M10-7 (done), M10-8 (the multidimensional boundary, open and
loud). Tests: `sv_whole_aggregate_value_copy`,
`sv_whole_aggregate_size_mismatch`.

**Verified, not assumed, on the way through:**

- DPI open arrays are complete — re-probed with a fresh C model, not an
  existing test: `svDimensions`/`svSize`/`svLow`/`svHigh`/`svLeft`/
  `svRight`/`svIncrement` all report the **declared** range for
  ascending, descending and non-zero-based actuals, elements read
  through `svGetArrElemPtr1`, and an `inout` formal writes back.
  GitHub issue #45 closed on that evidence.
- Multidimensional open arrays are **not** as done as M10-1's label
  said. A 2-D struct/class MEMBER works both ways (`%store/prop/arr/dar`
  walks `property_dimensions()`); a plain 2-D variable is an elaboration
  error, and a 2-D container does not parse at all — `int d[][];` is a
  syntax error. Recorded honestly as M10-8.

### Next frontier

**Nested containers.** M10-8 and R19 are the same missing subsystem seen
from two directions: a dynamic array whose elements are containers has
no parser rule, no type, and no runtime value. That is what a plain 2-D
open array, `int d[][]`, and `int m[string][]` all need. It is a
subsystem to build, not a fix to the open-array code, and it should be
its own campaign.

### Truth pass — 2026-07-28

The five `Phase 7x` GitHub issues were probed item by item rather than
read. #43, #44, #45 and #47 are closed: #45 genuinely complete, the
other three obsolete as tracking units (their acceptance criterion,
"96+/98 regression", names a suite that no longer exists). #46
(performance) is deliberately left open and unre-labelled — its claims
are wall-clock measurements I did not reproduce, and closing it on the
strength of the others would be the sort of unvalidated label this pass
exists to remove.

Sixteen of the twenty-eight probed items were already done. The
survivors carry forward as R17–R23. One correction to my own first
reading: `a.reverse()` returning nothing is **not** a defect — 7.12.2
ordering methods return void, so the r-value spelling I probed with is
not legal SystemVerilog. The in-place form works.

### Gates

`make check`, the vendored ivtest name-diff, bundled VPI, the negative
suite, the SVA dual-run, the DPI subsystem and full UVM — see the pull
request for the run.

One regression was caught by the name-diff and fixed rather than
absorbed: the first cut refused a multidimensional copy-back outright,
which broke `sv_struct_array_member_open_arg` — a member destination had
been working all along through `%store/prop/arr/dar`. The new path now
takes over **only** a plain word-array signal destination, which is the
one shape that had no instruction.
